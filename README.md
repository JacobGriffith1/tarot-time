## :memo: <span id="description">Description</span>
For our T3 end-of-trimester project, we were tasked with building a custom website based on the theme of animation. After brainstorming, our team landed on the idea of a tarot card reading experience. We were excited by the challenge of animating card spreads, card flips, and integrating these animations with stored data for personalized readings. Using the skills we developed throughout the trimester, we collaborated to bring this concept to life!

Features of our project:

- **Animated Homepage**: A visually dynamic homepage featuring moving hand animations
- **22-Card Spread**: Represents all the Major Arcana cards in a beautifully designed spread.
- **School-Appropriate Custom Card Images**: Redesigned card illustrations to ensure they are suitable for school setting by removing nudity while maintaining their artistic essence.
- **Custom Database Integration**: A database storing 5 distinct meanings for each card, seamlessly integrated into the user experience.

The team drew inspiration from the iconic Rider-Waite Tarot Deck, appreciating its timeless design and symbolism. This served as the foundation for our site's overall aesthetic.

For the color palette, we explored a celestial theme featuring shades of blue and gold, complemented by purple accents. Purple was particularly appealing due to its harmony with the yellow tones often found in Rider-Waite cards. Together, these colors created a cohesive and visually pleasing combination.

Our design goals were centered on delivering a celestial, dark aesthetic that feels immersive while ensuring the site remains intuitive and easy to navigate for users.

Our site was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve both its design and functionality.

One of the unexpected challenges we encountered was addressing the nudity present in some of the tarot cards. To ensure the project was school-appropriate, our team member Jacob devoted considerable time to redesigning these cards while maintaining their original essence and artistic integrity.

Another significant challenge was finding an API that supported a 5-card spread. After an extensive search, we realized such an API wasnâ€™t available, so Tamara took the initiative to create a custom database to meet our needs.

We also faced difficulties with the card functionality. Our goal was to implement an arched 22-card spread, complemented by flip animations for the 5 selected cards. While we initially planned to accomplish this using CSS, integrating these features proved to be more complex than anticipated due to the intricacies of the card interactions.
