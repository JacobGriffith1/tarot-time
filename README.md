## :memo: <span id="description">Description</span>
This project, built around the theme of animation, is a custom-designed 2+ page website. Our goal was to create a dynamic and engaging site that incorporates animations using modern web technologies such as CSS and JavaScript. The theme is open to interpretation, allowing us to explore personal interests and craft a site that reflects our unique vision and skills.

Whether itâ€™s a website for a fictional animation studio or an entirely different topic with integrated animations, this project demonstrates creativity, technical acumen, and the culmination of skills we've acquired throughout the trimester.
